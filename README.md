# Visualizing-Decision-Trees-with-DTreeViz-in-Python
This project uses dtreeviz to visualize decision trees, showing key techniques for interpreting decision-making in machine learning. Through detailed graphics of node splits, leaf predictions, and class probabilities, it illustrates model behavior and feature importance, enhancing understanding of decision paths in binary classification.
